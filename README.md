# Iterative LQR to control 2D-Drone

This program uses a control technique called LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) to stabilize a 2D drone and make it follow a circular path with high accuracy. Additionally, the author also used an iterative version of LQR to make the drone perform a flip.

LQR is a popular control technique that uses feedback to regulate the dynamics of a system. In the case of this 2D drone, LQR is used to stabilize its motion and ensure that it follows a desired trajectory accurately. The iterative version of LQR is a more advanced technique that is used to achieve more complex control objectives, such as making the drone perform a flip.
